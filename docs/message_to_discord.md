# Discord

### Discord Staff Team:


Discord has changed my life since I ever found it.

I honestly started on discord with no idea what to do, I was ready to leave and I soon realized the power and greatness of discord.

Discord has brought me new friends of all kinds that I would never have found just chilling on skype or even at school. Discord is just unique for what it is and one of the most interesting applications I have ever seen. I will always support discord, and never leave it.

I've been a nitro subscriber for almost 1.5 month(s) now and will continue to be one, I'm constantly getting merch from discord just becuase its amazing!

I didn't get nitro for a GIF profile pic, infact I don't even have one.

For me, Discord has been a replacement to all social media, life, and anything else I'd ever need.

On discord I can get my daily memes from the Game Nights server,

I can get my daily game from gaming servers, my daily code from code servers, my daily hacks from hacking servers, my daily cheats, from gaming servers.

I can get my daily entertainment from discord servers and my daily friends from discord. I rely on discord now to just ignore discord.

I was living a lonely life with no friends before I came to discord, being homeschooled doesn't really help either, then discord came to my face, and I instantly found thousands of people to talk to in seconds, and it isn't like IRC or Skype where all you find is people who either want to boot you off or is an eWhore.

Discord has helped my find my closest friends such as:

Neura - Someone I'd love to meet IRL whem I get the money to do so, we basically do everything together.

HotShot - Someone who has been sweet and nice since the start, someone you can always trust with anything. 

Lyon - Someone who helped me get started on discord, someone who protected me from those who tried to RAT, or log my IP.

Farhan - Someone who I always talk with, someone who is always there to give you some classic memes.

Xeno - Someone who has been there to help me get to know others, someone who has has introduced me to others, and the very person who introduced me to anime. 

Clv - Someone who has brought me into this botting situation I'm in :P. Honestly he's just cool to talk to and writes cool code.

Proto - Someone who helped me get way in depth with Neural Networks and creating good parsing systems.

Logan - A student of mine who turned into a close buddy, he may be young, but for his skills, that's amazing and I'm proud of him.

Moh - Someone who has always been there, someone you can always ask him for something, and he will help you in whatever way he can. This person is someone you won't ever find. He's just too nice.

Refresh - Someone who was helped when I was in need, when I was being attacked by HackForum members.

Trevor Page:

Owner of `How to program with Java` (http://howtoprogramwithjava.org) and was one of the first people I met online. Back in 2010 when I was learning java he was always there to help me.

Awake - One of my first friends on discord, the one who decided to download my malware, and that's how we became friends :joy:

Blank//Shiro//Senpai - Has been there to help to talk to people without messing up.

Kevin - The first person I ever did a project with, meeting him off of ROBLOX Devforums and now one of my closest friends.

Robbie - A person who deserved the respect that he has now from the start, has always been there for all.

Kai - he may be gay, but he is honestly someone you can accept as a friend and forget that he is gay. He is someone who has been supportive of my RaidBot project as well.

and so many more that I could keep talking about, and I know you are all reading this and you know who you are, you've helped me or have been a good friend out there.

Honestly, I can't thank your team enough for creating discord, and I really would love to work for you when I'm old enough. Being an intern for a medical company where the CTO is 40 years old and doesn't have a good sense of humor isn't really fun. I'd love to work with you as an intern. I plan on applying to discord once I grad college.

Thank you discord for helping me find my friends and helping get me to where I am now. I don't think I'd ever be this great at programming and RESTful API's without Discord.

To the team at Discord INC:

Thank you,

   ~bin.
